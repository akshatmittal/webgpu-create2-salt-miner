- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error recovery and system stability

## Technical Details

### Workgroup Size Changes
```wgsl
// Before
@compute @workgroup_size(8)

// After  
@compute @workgroup_size(64)
```

### Buffer Pooling Implementation
```typescript
// Efficient buffer reuse instead of constant allocation
const buffer = miningGpu.getBufferFromPool(size, usage);
// ... use buffer ...
miningGpu.returnBufferToPool(buffer, size, usage);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Real-time performance tracking
this.stats.gpuTime = gpuTime;
this.stats.cpuTime = cpuTime;
this.stats.bufferAllocationTime = bufferAllocationTime;
```

## Usage Recommendations

### Optimal Settings
- **Workgroup Size**: Use 64K for high-end GPUs, 16K for mid-range, 4K for low-end
- **Target Zeros**: Start with 4-6 for testing, increase for production mining
- **Max Results**: 10-20 for most use cases

### Hardware Considerations
- **High-end GPUs**: RTX 3080/4080, RX 6800/7800 - Use maximum workgroup size
- **Mid-range GPUs**: RTX 3060/4060, RX 6600/7600 - Use 16K workgroup size
- **Integrated GPUs**: Use 4K workgroup size and lower iteration counts
